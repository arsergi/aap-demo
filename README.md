# aap-demo

Local cluster infrastructure for AAP 2.7 deployment, powered by OpenShift Local.
Deploy AAP in minutes on macOS, Linux, or Windows.

## Overview

aap-demo deploys Ansible Automation Platform 2.7 to OpenShift Local (MicroShift) for development, testing, and demonstration.

**Key characteristics:**

- One command setup: `aap-demo deploy`
- Full OpenShift API compatibility (OLM, Routes, CRDs)
- Shared Podman/CRI-O storage — locally built images are immediately available to pods
- In-cluster registry at `registry.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io`
- Valid TLS certificates (auto-trusted on macOS/Linux)
- Addon system: `aap-demo enable mcp-server`
- Reproducible — destroy and recreate in minutes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### System Requirements

A typical Microshift and AAP 2.7 environment requires 16GB of RAM, 2 cores, and
100 GB of storage. We recommend having a total of 32GB RAM available on your system.

#### MacOS

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) — Install with: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/) — Install with: `brew install operator-sdk`

#### Windows

- Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, or Server (Hyper-V is not available on Windows 11 Home)
- [OpenShift Local](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local) — includes `crc`; Hyper-V must be enabled
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) — optional for `create`/`deploy`/`status`;
  required for `diagnose`, `test`, `watch`, and other advanced commands

  ```powershell
  winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
  ```

- PowerShell 5.1 or later (included with Windows 10/11)

#### OpenShift Local

- OpenShift Local — [Install](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create/local)
- On Linux: also install `libvirt-daemon`, `libvirt-daemon-driver-storage`, `libvirt-daemon-driver-network`, `qemu-kvm`
- On Windows: Hyper-V enabled (OpenShift Local requirement)
- Obtain a **Pull Secret** from the [Red Hat Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret)

### macOS / Linux

#### Download your pull secret from [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) and save it

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.aap-demo
cp ~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt ~/.aap-demo/pull-secret.txt
```

#### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/aap-demo.git
cd aap-demo && ./install.sh
```

#### Deploy

```bash
aap-demo deploy        # Deploy AAP 2.7
aap-demo status        # Check deployment status
```

### Windows

See the **[Windows installer guide](powershell/README.md)** for full install and usage
instructions. Summary:

#### Save your pull secret

Download from [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) and save as:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.aap-demo"
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\pull-secret.txt" "$env:USERPROFILE\.aap-demo\pull-secret.txt"
```

#### Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/aap-demo.git
cd aap-demo
.\powershell\install.ps1
```

This registers the repo path, installs the `aap-demo` launcher to
`%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`, adds that directory to your user PATH, and downloads
`operator-sdk` if needed.

Open a **new** PowerShell window after install so PATH changes take effect.

#### Deploy

```powershell
aap-demo create        # Create the cluster
aap-demo deploy        # Deploy AAP 2.7
aap-demo status        # Check deployment status
```

#### Uninstall

```powershell
.\powershell\install.ps1 -Uninstall
```

This removes the wrapper and PATH entry. It does not delete `%USERPROFILE%\.crc\` or
other cluster data.

#### Windows notes

- Kubeconfig default: `%USERPROFILE%\.crc\machines\crc\kubeconfig`
- Config file: `%USERPROFILE%\.aap-demo\config`
- If `aap-demo` is not recognized, confirm `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` is on PATH and
  restart PowerShell
- `create`, `deploy`, and `status` are PowerShell-native; install Git for Windows for
  other commands (`diagnose`, `test`, `watch`, …)
- See [powershell/README.md](powershell/README.md) for full Windows install and usage

Once deployed, `aap-demo status` shows routes, credentials, and cluster health:

```text
Infra:       crc
Cluster:     running

Namespaces:
-----------
  aap-operator         27/27 pods   aap  https://aap-aap-operator.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io
  olm                  4/4 pods

Credentials:
------------
  aap-operator:        admin / <password>

Enabled Addons:
---------------
  console         https://console.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io
  registry        https://registry.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

### Self-Service Portal (AAP 2.7)

Deploy the Ansible Automation Portal (Red Hat Developer Hub + AAP plugins) as a Helm addon:

```bash
aap-demo enable portal       # Auto-detects cluster CPU (amd64 vs arm64)
aap-demo disable portal
aap-demo status portal       # Portal route URL
```

**Requirements:** AAP deployed, Helm 3.10+, `registry.redhat.io` credentials for OCI plugins.

**Profiles:** x86 clusters use Red Hat RHDH chart images; arm64 clusters (e.g. CRC on Apple
Silicon) use community multi-arch RHDH overrides. See
[ADR-002](docs/adr/002-portal-helm-deployment.md) and [addons/portal/README.md](addons/portal/README.md).

## Deploy MCP Server

```bash
aap-demo enable mcp-server     # MCP server for AI assistants
aap-demo disable mcp-server
```

## Fleet — Local Managed Nodes

Fleet spins up lightweight QEMU virtual machines on your host as managed nodes for AAP.
Each VM runs a RHEL/CentOS cloud image with an `ansible` user and SSH key pre-injected,
so AAP can run automation against real hosts without any external infrastructure.

### Requirements

- **QEMU** — `brew install qemu` (macOS) or `dnf install qemu-kvm` (Linux)
- **mkisofs** — `brew install cdrtools` (macOS) or `dnf install genisoimage` (Linux)
- **A RHEL/CentOS QCOW2 cloud image** matching your host architecture (aarch64 for Apple Silicon, x86_64 for Intel/AMD)
- **macOS firewall** must allow QEMU connections (System Settings → Network → Firewall → allow `qemu-system-*`)

### Resource Usage

Each fleet node uses **1 GB RAM** and **2 vCPUs** by default (configurable via
`FLEET_NODE_MEM` and `FLEET_NODE_CPUS`). Disk usage is minimal — the base QCOW2
image is copied once (~700 MB–2 GB depending on the image), and each node gets a
thin copy-on-write overlay (~200 KB initially, grows as the VM writes data).

With the default CRC VM (16 GB RAM), 2–3 fleet nodes is a comfortable fit. Larger
fleets may require increasing host memory or reducing node sizes.

### Usage

```bash
# Deploy AAP with fleet nodes in one command
aap-demo deploy --fleet 3 --image ~/rhel9.qcow2

# Or add nodes to an existing AAP deployment
aap-demo fleet add 2 --image ~/rhel9.qcow2
aap-demo fleet list
aap-demo fleet remove 1
aap-demo fleet destroy
```

The `--image` path is saved to `~/.aap-demo/config`, so subsequent `fleet add`
commands don't need it again.

### What Happens on Deploy

1. The base QCOW2 image is copied to `~/.aap-demo/fleet/base.qcow2`
2. Each node gets a thin overlay disk and a cloud-init ISO (creates the `ansible` user with an auto-generated SSH key)
3. QEMU launches each VM with a host port forward for SSH (ports 2200, 2201, …)
4. Nodes are registered in AAP as an inventory called **"Fleet"** with a credential called **"Fleet SSH Key"**
5. An ad-hoc ping verifies end-to-end connectivity

### Using Fleet Nodes in AAP

Fleet nodes appear in the **Fleet** inventory in the AAP UI. To run automation
against them, create a Job Template and assign:

- **Inventory:** Fleet
- **Credential:** Fleet SSH Key

The "Fleet SSH Key" credential is created automatically during registration with
the generated SSH private key. You must select it on any Job Template that targets
fleet nodes — it is not applied by default.

### Lifecycle

Fleet nodes are **ephemeral** — `aap-demo stop` kills all VMs, and `aap-demo destroy`
removes them entirely. After a stop/start cycle, re-create nodes with `aap-demo fleet add`.
This is by design: no VM state to corrupt, and fresh nodes spin up in seconds.

### Fleet Environment Variables

```bash
FLEET_NODE_MEM=1024      # VM memory in MB (default: 1024)
FLEET_NODE_CPUS=2        # VM CPU count (default: 2)
FLEET_IMAGE=~/rhel9.qcow2  # Default QCOW2 image path
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Deployment
aap-demo deploy              # Deploy AAP 2.7

# Cluster management
aap-demo status              # Show cluster status, routes, credentials
aap-demo stop                # Stop the cluster
aap-demo start               # Start the cluster
aap-demo ssh                 # SSH into the cluster node
aap-demo watch               # Monitor deployment progress
aap-demo destroy             # Delete entire cluster

# AAP Operator Idle
aap-demo idle true           # Scale down AAP to save resources
aap-demo idle false          # Scale back up
aap-demo idle                # Check current idle state

# Troubleshooting
aap-demo diagnose            # Quick health check (cluster, storage, SCCs, pods)
aap-demo must-gather         # Collect full diagnostics (AAP + cluster)
aap-demo must-gather /tmp/d  # Collect to specific directory

# Maintenance
aap-demo clean               # Remove AAP deployment (keeps cluster)
aap-demo update              # Pull latest code and reinstall
aap-demo help                # Full command reference
```

## Architecture

### macOS / Linux / Windows

- **Networking:** SSH (2222), API (6443), HTTP/HTTPS (443) — all on localhost
- **Routes:** `*.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io` (nip.io DNS, no /etc/hosts needed)
- **TLS:** MicroShift's ingress CA auto-trusted on macOS keychain / Linux ca-trust/
  Windows via certutil

## Environment Variables

```bash
CRC_CPUS=8                   # VM CPU count (default: 8)
CRC_MEMORY=16384             # VM memory in MiB (default: 16384)
CRC_DISK=100                 # VM disk size in GiB (default: 100)
CRC_PV_SIZE=70               # Storage reserved for LVMS PVCs in GiB (default: 70, must be < CRC_DISK)
NAMESPACE=aap-operator       # Target namespace
QUIET=true                   # Suppress disclaimer
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
aap-demo diagnose              # Quick health check — identifies common issues
aap-demo diagnose --ai         # Health check + AI-powered analysis (requires claude CLI)
aap-demo must-gather           # Collect full diagnostics for support
aap-demo status                # Check cluster and AAP status
aap-demo ssh                   # SSH into cluster node for debugging
aap-demo repair                # Repair after crash/sleep
aap-demo destroy && aap-demo create && aap-demo deploy   # Full rebuild
```

`aap-demo diagnose` checks cluster connectivity, storage classes, SCCs, namespace
labels, AAP CR status, pod health, PVC binding, and DNS. It provides actionable fix
suggestions for any issues found.

`aap-demo diagnose --ai` runs the same checks, then sends the results plus pod logs
and events to [Claude](https://claude.ai) for AI-powered root cause analysis and fix
suggestions. Requires the `claude` CLI
([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)).

`aap-demo must-gather` collects aap-demo config, CRC status, storage/PVC/pod/event
data, and runs the official [AAP must-gather](https://github.com/ansible/aap-must-gather)
image for operator-level diagnostics.

### AI-Assisted Development

This repository includes a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file that provides Claude Code with
full aap-demo context. When running Claude Code in the aap-demo directory, it
automatically understands the architecture, common issues, and troubleshooting patterns.

## Testing

Test suite validates core aap-demo commands without requiring cluster operations:

```bash
./test/test-core-commands.sh
```

Tests verify:

- `status` - execution and output format
- `start` - CRC startup + CoreDNS reconfiguration (fixes DNS after restarts)
- `stop` - CRC shutdown
- `destroy` - warning messages and cleanup logic
- `create` - script delegation and OLM setup

All tests use grep verification or command mocking to avoid destructive operations.
